                                  <p class="card-text">Taylor Alison Swift or commonly known by her stage name Taylor Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her narrative songwriting, which often centers around her personal life, has received critical acclaim and extensive media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania,[4] Taylor Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at age 14 to pursue a career in country music. Her self-titled debut studio album is the longest-running 2000s album on the Billboard 200. The album's third single, "Our Song", made her the youngest singer to self-write and perform a number one song on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. Swift's second studio album, Fearless (2008), featured a country pop style and won the Grammy Awards as Album of the Year. Buoyed by the success of mixed-genre singles such as "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me", Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Speak Now, his third studio album, mixes country pop with a blend of rock and produced Top 10 singles "Mine" and "Back to December".</p>
